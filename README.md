Todo List
=========

1. Add a look-alike search functionality. Type "a" into a search box and a æ ɑ ɒ will be highlighted (via Su W.)
2. More information on hover over of character (via Shu W.)
   - Link to Wikipedia entry of character.
   - Link to play audio file (HTML5 Audio)
3. Update to not use frames; just show the character buffer when URL fragment is present.
4. Option to customize the chart, changing the default layout, adding additional characters not found on the official chart, or replacing some with your own, for example:
   - in the line of ieɛa an additional vowel between /i/ and /e/  (via Hermann F.)
   - in the line of uoɔɒ an additional vowel between /o/ and /ɔ/  (via ibid.)
   - in the line of yøœɶ an additional vowel between /ø/ and /œ/  (via ibid.)
   - raised 'm' symbol like the nasalised 'n', used in transcibing the word /amahlombe/ from Zulu, found in South Africa
   - putting the epiglottal consonants together up with the main consonants (via Percy W.)
   - the superscript equal sign to mark an unaspirated stop (eg. '40' = /'fɔr t⁼i/) (via James N.)
   - addng u025D ɝ
   - alternate voiceless diacritic for glyphs with descenders? e.g. U+030A (via Jason T.)
5. Ability to change default font
