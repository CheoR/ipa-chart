<h1><a href="./">IPA Chart</a> Changelog</h1>



<p>Here are listed changes that I have made to the IPA Chart. Most of
the changes are the result of comments and feedback from users of the
chart. I am very thankful for their help.</p>


<h2>2007-10-22: Paul</h2>
<p>Paul wrote in noticing that "[t]here are just a couple of clitches in the 'Tone and Word Accents' area. For example, the mid bar is linked to a lower bar in the pop-up. I think that the alt="" values are off set by one value." I have resolved this issue.</p>

<!--

<h2>2007-02-21: Isaac C. and [NAME]</h2>
<p>I have implemented the new characters in Unicode 5.0 and also including those which are shown on the Wikipedia page.</p>


-->
<h2>2006-03-13:&nbsp;Isaac C.</h2>



Per the suggestions of Kirk and another very insightful email from Isaac C. (see below), I have made the following changes:<br>



<ul>



  <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">For the Pulmonic Consonant table, utilized the semantic </span><code style="text-decoration: line-through;">caption</code><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> element instead of a generic paragraph.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Reverted for now.</span></li>



  <li>Added the new <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/CharisSILfont">Charis SIL</a> font as the preferred font; if it is not installed, the&nbsp;existing <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/DoulosSILfont">Doulos SIL</a> and new <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Gentium">Gentium</a>&nbsp;are the next&nbsp;preferred fonts; I added a recommendation for these two new SIL fonts in the footer.</li>



  <li>Added the new IPA symbol, the labiodental flap: U+F25F "LATIN SMALL LETTER V WITH RIGHT HOOK" <a href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ipa/flap.htm">[1]</a></li>



  <li>Replaced the letter schwa with the rhotic hook diacritic with U+025A "LATIN SMALL LETTER SCHWA WITH HOOK".</li>



  <li>Added contour tone letters.</li>



  <li>Added remaining contour tone diacritics, but they will remain commented out until Unicode 5.0.</li>



  <li>In keyboard mode, substituted level diacritics base character from&nbsp;U+2002 "EN SPACE" to&nbsp;U+25CC "DOTTED
CIRCLE"</li>



</ul>


Additional changes I have made:<br>


<ul>


  <li>Changed the keyboard frameset from scrolling=yes to auto; this removes the disabled horizontal scrollbar in Firefox and Opera.</li>


  <li>Changed the symbol for the Velarized or pharyngealized diacritic from the simple tilde to the combining.</li>


  <li>For the over- and under-tiebars, I added generic examples of
both with U+25CC&nbsp;DOTTED CIRCLE; clicking this in keyboard mode
will insert the tie bar by itself.</li>


  <li>Added PayPal donate link to IPA Chart footer.</li>


  <li>The keyboard now works in Opera, version 9 (and perhaps lower).</li>


</ul>


Issues remaining to be resolved:
<ul>


  <li>Tones and Word Accents: add more tone contour letters?</li>


  <li>There is too much whitespace.</li>


</ul>




<p>This round of changes was prompted by a very insightful email&nbsp;I received from Isaac C. on March 12th, 2006:</p>



<blockquote style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote">
  
  
  
  
  <p>Thanks for the IPA keyboard. I must first say that you've done a
great job getting this application up. I especially like the
arrangement of the content--it looks just like the original IPA chart
itself.</p>




  
  
  
  
  <p>However, I found that the part about bottom ties not
supported is untrue. If you look at the Unicode Standard 4.1, there is,
at U+035C, a "COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW", which essentially is the
bottom tie bar you're looking for. This is supported by Doulos SIL too.
You might want to consider adding it in.</p>




  
  
  
  
  <p>(Technical note: If you
use Character Map, Doulos SIL will show the bottom tie bar under the
Private Use Area (PUA)&nbsp;&nbsp; at U+F176 and not U+035C. This is not a
problem because within the font file both codes are mapped to the same
glyph (dual-mapping).)</p>




  
  
  
  
  <p>I read your changelog and apparently Kirk
already told you that "Your comment that the contour tone diacritics
and tone letters are not supported by Unicode is misleading." Doulos
SIL indeed does support it, and I've included the following Unicode
values you can use to display the characters:</p>




  
  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>Rising: U+02E9 U+02E5 (&amp;#x2E9;&amp;#x2E5;)</li>



    <li>Falling: U+02E5 U+02E9 (&amp;#x2E5;&amp;#x2E9;)</li>



    <li>High Rising: U+02E7 U+02E5 (&amp;#x2E6;&amp;#x2E5;)</li>



    <li>Low Rising: U+02E9 U+02E7 (&amp;#x2E9;&amp;#x2E8;)</li>



    <li>High Falling: U+02E5 U+02E7 (&amp;#x2E5;&amp;#x2E6;)</li>



    <li>Low Falling: U+02E7 U+02E9 (&amp;#x2E8;&amp;#x2E9;)</li>



    <li>Peaking: U+02E5 U+02E4 U+02E5 (&amp;#x2E7;&amp;#x2E6;&amp;#x2E7;)</li>



    <li>Dipping: U+02E5 U+02E6 U+02E5 (&amp;#x2E7;&amp;#x2E8;&amp;#x2E7;)</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>




  
  
  
  
  <p>There must not be any space between these tone characters or they will not display.</p>




  
  
  
  
  <p>Though
Doulos SIL supports the diacritics for contour-tones, it is Unicode 4.1
unofficial (the codes are in the PUA). It is going to be in Unicode 5.0:</p>




  
  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>U+1DC4 COMBINING MACRON-ACUTE</li>



    <li>U+1DC5 COMBINING GRAVE-MACRON</li>



    <li>U+1DC6 COMBINING MACRON-GRAVE</li>



    <li>U+1DC7 COMBINING ACUTE-MACRON</li>



    <li>U+1DC8 COMBINING GRAVE-ACUTE-GRAVE</li>



    <li>U+1DC9 COMBINING ACUTE-GRAVE-ACUTE</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>




  
  
  
  
  <p>You might want to include these as a precursor to the upcoming new standard.</p>




  
  
  
  
  <p>Speaking
of diacritics, you might want to use Unicode standard U+25CC "DOTTED
CIRCLE" as the placeholder for the them instead of U+2002 "EN SPACE".
This I feel will bring more brevity to where the diacritics be applied
unto another character.</p>




  
  
  
  
  <p>The rhotic schwa could be more accurately
represented as U+025A "LATIN SMALL LETTER SCHWA WITH HOOK" rather than
the letter schwa with the rhotic hook diacritic. I have some
reservations on whether this is necessary because in the future such
compound atomic characters might be obselete, as glyph mutation through
different code sequences is already supported (quintessentially shown
by the contour-tone case), just not so widely used. Perhaps fonts next
time will automatically display this glyph when the schwa and rhotic
hook are put together respectively? You might want to consider placing
it on your keyboard anyway, since it is not done in Doulos SIL or
Charis SIL.</p>




  
  
  
  
  <p>Have you considered adding the ExtIPA characters into
your keyboard? I thought this might be a useful extension of what
you've done now. I believe most of the characters required for ExtIPA
exist in the Unicode specification now.</p>

<h2>2005-12-11: Kirk M.</h2>




Kirk sent me a few comments for the chart. The corrections he suggested
and what I did with them appear below:
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1. Could
you replace the &lt;g&gt; with its IPA equivalent? There's no
need of your chart just for traditional &lt;g&gt;.</p>




<span style="font-style: italic;">[In an email
conversation with Kirk]</span> You are right, the IPA Handbook
provides both on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;id=33BSkFV_8PEC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=110&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Dipa%2Bhandbook&amp;sig=BVoDftjOxq9LBPOJFw3ohISw5WI" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">
page 179</a>. The ASCII &lt;<span>g</span><span>&gt;
is referred to as "#210: Looptail G," which Unicode classifies as "</span><span>U+0067:
</span><span>LATIN SMALL LETTER G." </span><span>The
one shown on the IPA chart &lt;</span><span>&#609;</span><span>&gt;
is referred to as</span><span>"#110:
Opentail G," which Unicode classifies as "U+0261: LATIN SMALL LETTER
SCRIPT G." Additionally, Unicode comments that this character U+0261 is
a "voiced velar stop," a comment which is not provided for U+0067.<br>




</span><span><br>




As you have mentioned, both the IPA Handbook and the <a href="http://www.travelphrases.info/gallery/Test_IPA.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">IPA
Unicode Test Page</a> state that these two characters are
equivalent:</span><span><br>




<br>




</span>
<blockquote style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote"><span> IPA #110 (above) and IPA
#210 (left) are equivalent "Voiced velar plosive" symbols. </span><br>




  <span>IPA #110's symbol name is "Opentail G" while #210's is
"Looptail G".</span><br>




  <span></span></blockquote>




<span><br>




</span><span>Being that these two character are </span><span>equivalent,
</span><span>which
one is preferable? Opentail G would seem to be preferred as it is the
one which appears on the IPA chart. However, the traditional Looptail G
is obviously supported by more fonts being that it has the benefit of
being within the ASCII range. </span><span></span><br>




<br>




The <a href="http://www.blugs.com/IPA/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">IPA
Palette</a> decided it was
necessary to replace "regular 'latin small letter g' (U+0067) with
'latin small letter script g' (U+0261)." You also give a good reason
for this replacement in that "it would be nice to be able to get the
other
one using" the chart. I will go ahead and replace&nbsp;U+0067
with&nbsp;U+0261.
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2. Your
comment that
the contour tone diacritics and tone letters are not supported by
Unicode is misleading. They need to be rendered in the IPA font, just
as most other sequences of diacritics. Doulos SIL has now made a start
on this.</p>



<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">See above.</span><br>




<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3.
(Minor point.)
Upstep and downstep are not supported by Unicode. What you have are
ingressive and egressive airflow, used by the ExtIPA. Hopefully
superscript arrows will be supported soon.</p>



<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
[action pending...]</span><br>




<br>




<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thank you Kirk!</span>
<h2>2005-07-28:&nbsp;Sylvester</h2>




<p>Added diacritics for
rising (U+030C: Combining Caron) and falling (U+0302: Combining
Circumflex Accent) tones; thanks to Sylvester.</p>




<h2>2005-01-24:&nbsp;Mark D.</h2>




<p>Corrected spelling of
"plumonic" to "pulmonic". Many thanks to Mark D. for bringing this to
my attention.</p>
